Since I started to learn software development i always wanted to find the best way to setup my workstation in the best way to be productive and enjoy crafting software. I tried **A LOT** of different configuration, software, workflow without being fully happy with it. Good news, i found my dream setup / workflow to be productive and happy when I'm programming and in this article I'll explain How and Why I setup my Macbook in the way i did.

I'll not try to convince you that my way to work is the best, i truly think that everyone like to work differently and that everyone should spend at least a little amount of time finding what's suits you more. Maybe you'll found inspiration on my article, maybe not but at least i hope it will bring you the wish to explore all the possibilities we have in 2022 to setup our workstation the way we love it.

I Started my dev journey 10 years ago with a HP (Hewlett Packard), 3 years later I was switching for the apple ecosystem with the Iphone, the Apple Watch and finally the Macbook, since this time I never came back from the Apple ecosystem. The UNIX based Operating System (Mac OS) have everything I need to be productive and everything I like from the UX/UI perspective. Today I work mainly with a Mac Mini M1 since I work from home most of the time but I also own a Macbook Air M1 if I need to work from a public coffee with a friend or if I need to see a client.
