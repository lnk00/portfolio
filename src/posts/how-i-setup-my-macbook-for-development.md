# How I setup my Macbook for development

![](https://zqkcqobnogebhjukuqup.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/abstract-2-cover.jpg)

Since I started to learn software development i always wanted to find the best way to setup my workstation in the best way to be productive and enjoy crafting software. I tried a lot of different configurations, software, workflows without being fully happy with it. Good news, i found my dream setup / workflow to be productive and happy when I'm programming and in this article I'll explain How and Why I setup my Macbook in the way i did.

I'll not try to convince you that my way to work is the best, i truly think that everyone like to work differently and that everyone should spend at least a little amount of time finding what's suits you more. Maybe you'll find inspiration on my article, maybe not but at least i hope it will bring you the wish to explore all the possibilities we have in 2023 to setup our workstation the way we love it.

## Hardware

### Computer

I Started my dev journey 10 years ago with a HP (Hewlett Packard), 3 years later I was switching for the apple ecosystem with the Iphone, the Apple Watch and finally the Macbook, since this time I never came back from the Apple ecosystem. The UNIX based Operating System (Mac OS) have everything I need to be productive and everything I like from the UX/UI perspective. Today I work mainly with a Mac Mini M1 since I work from home most of the time but I also own a Macbook Air M1 if I need to work from a public coffee with a friend or if I need to see a client.

### Keyboard

My keyboard is a Keycheron K2, a mechanical keyboard with red switches because I like the linear feeling of these switches, I found my hands a little more exhausted at the end of the day with switches more bumpy like the blue ones. I used to be happy with the apple keyboard because I had my habits on it but after a few weeks of intensive use of a mechanical keyboard I couldn't return from it. In my workflow I use a lot my keyboard since my text editor is terminal based, also, my internet navigation is keyboard driven thanks to the safari extension Vimari !

### Monitors

My monitors are 2 Samsung WQHD 144hz 27". I like to have space to put all I need on my screens at the same time and don't have to switch between windows too much, again, because I try to remove my hands from my keyboard the less I can. I use the screens in the landscape mode, I also tried the portrait mode but it felt weird and the profit it should give for programming didn't convince me at all.

### Audio

Music take an important place in my days so I invested in the Sony XM4 few years ago, and I'm still pretty happy with it. When i need more mobility I'm taking my airpods pro but I always go with my sony if I need quality and comfort.

## Software

### Text Editor

I'm the type of dev who have switched a lot of times between text editor, I've probably tried every decent editor and i ended using VIM. I've started
my dev journey by writing code using a terminal based text editor with EMACS when I was student. Then I was in a discovering phase where I tried Sublim Text, Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ, Atom, and few others. In every single one of them there was something I didn't like, from the lack of customisation to the over consumption of resources I wasn't fully satisfied of my workflow while I was programming. I finally come back t the basics and try another terminal based text editor, VIM. It can be really powerful once you get used to the keyboard only editing and you customized it to your needs. For the customisation part I use LUNAR VIM which is a pre configured version of VIM. Since 2 years now I use only VIM to edit my code and even this blog article you are reading right now. I'm pretty happy with the workflow I'm working with now and I don't feel anymore the need to switch between text editors.

### Utilities

I don't use a lot of different software in my daily routine, I'm into minimalism and I think the less I use the more efficient I'm. This being said, I always have Apple music open to have an ambient sound either with music or podcast. I also use TickTick for my weekly planning/task management and slack to communicate easily with people I work with.
