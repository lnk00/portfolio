Since I started to learn software development i always wanted to find the best way to setup my workstation in the best way to be productive and enjoy crafting software. I tried **A LOT** of different configuration, software, workflow without being fully happy with it. Good news, i found my dream setup / workflow to be productive and happy when I'm programming and in this article I'll explain How and Why I setup my Macbook in the way i did.

I'll not try to convince you that my way to work is the best, i truly think that everyone like to work differently and that everyone should spend at least a little amount of time finding what's suits you more. Maybe you'll found inspiration on my article, maybe not but at least i hope it will bring you the wish to explore all the possibilities we have in 2022 to setup our workstation the way we love it.
